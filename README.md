go-rtk
==============

Partial Go port of python [RTk package](https://github.com/PiSupply/Ryanteck/tree/master/RTK.GPIO/Software).

This should allow reading and writing from GPIO pins but not all the 
features have been ported.

The RTk device shows up as a serial device in linux under `/dev/serial`.

For the examples to run you would probably need to set the correct port name.
